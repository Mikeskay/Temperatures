# Temperatures
Design a class, DayTemperatures, to record a set of hourly temperature readings over the course of a day. The class should include a method, hottesthours, that returns an array of the hottest hours. The length of the array will vary according to the number of hours in the day that have the same highest temperature. You may assume that these hours are numbered according to the 24 hour clock, that is they have values in the range 0 .. 23. It should also include a method, meanTemperature, that returns the mean temperature for the day.
